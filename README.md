# Description

`ModKit` includes dozens of helpful extensions and each has detailed documentation.
Some of them are syntactic sugar to improve code readability, the other part introduces new functionality. 
All this so that you can enjoy *Swift* development. 

For me personally, all these extensions have become a part of the *Swift* programming language 
and I can't imagine development without this library. 
I still collect and update it from time to time.


# Installation

In order to install `ModKit`, you add the following url in Xcode with the Swift Package Manager.
