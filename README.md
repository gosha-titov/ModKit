# Description

`ModKit` includes dozens of helpful extensions, each with detailed documentation.
Some of them are syntactic sugar to improve code readability, while others introduce new functionality. 
All this is designed so that you can enjoy *Swift* development. 

For me personally, these extensions have become a part of the *Swift* programming language, 
and I can't imagine development without this library. 
I still update it and add new features from time to time.


# Installation

In order to install `ModKit`, you add the following URL in Xcode with the Swift Package Manager.

```
